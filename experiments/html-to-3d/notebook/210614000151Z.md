I found this article to be helpful: https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-align-html-elements-to-3d.html.  This article seems to have the incantations necessary to position an element, such as a `<div>` at a specific location relative to the origin of the [**threejs**](https://threejs.org) canvas.

But what I really want to do is render Latex to a document element and display that element at a specific location relative to the origin of the [**threejs**](https://threejs.org) canvas.  Preferably, I would  display it in [**threejs**](https://threejs.org) coordinates.  Preferably, I would use [**katex**](https://katex.org/).

- [ ] It would be amazing if I could get it to render automatically as a mesh within threejs. i.e. some kind of extension to [**threejs**]](https://threejs.org).

But before I can do that, I must discover a way to include `katex.css`  in the `index.html` generated by [**webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/), because I have chosen webpack as my development bundler/server..

For that, I will need to understand much more about  [**webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/).

[**html-webpack-plugin**](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) seems an appropriate mechanism, but so far its documentation has not revealed a way to include bundles AND a `css`.  I can get one or the other.

Made some progress on getting [**katex**](https://katex.org/) to work.  Got [**html-webpack-plugin**](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) to do something acceptable for `katex/dist/katex.css`. 

- [ ] The y position of drawKatex() seems to render at 1/2 the expected rate.  I.e. An x at (1, 1) looks more like an x at (1, 0.5).  Doubling the y value passed in gives about the right answer.

- [ ] The [**html-webpack-plugin**](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) usage works, but seems kind of weird, because I'm importing `katex/dist/katex.css` in `index.js`, which just seems off.  I feel more like I'd like to have `katex/dist/katex.css` as part of a `<link>` tag in the `index.html`.  Making a template `index.html` would probably be the easiest answer.

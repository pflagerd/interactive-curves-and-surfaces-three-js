# Interactive Curves and Surfaces Reboot (A threejs tutorial on CAGD).

This project is about learning CAGD (Computer Aided Geometric Design) by writing javascript using threejs to create applications similar to those described in the book Interactive Curves and Surfaces (A multimedia tutorial on CAGD) - Rockwell et al.

You do not need to read that book because its text has been transcribed herein as Markdown files in the `md/` directory.  You read the lessons in `md/`, in alphabetic order, sub-directory by sub-directory, file by file.

For example, start reading ` 1 Introduction to CAGD/1.md`



### What are all these directories and files for?

Consult the file .readme.md for descriptions of each file/directory in this project.

Directories often have their own README.md and TODO.md.  Consult these for details on what's going on in that directory.

One important thing you should know is that the directory `template/`   provides a simple webpack-based web client development toolchain for threejs. It is intended to be copied to a different (new) directory and modified.  

`template/` has its own README.md (and TODO.md) which you should consult for details about how to perform this particular webpack-based development workflow using the toolchain provided.  For example, README.md will tell you how to build, debug and deploy a program starting from `template/`.

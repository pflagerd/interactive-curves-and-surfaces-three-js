# Interactive Curves and Surfaces Reboot (A threejs tutorial on CAGD).

This project is about learning CAGD (Computer Aided Geometric Design) by writing javascript using threejs to create applications similar to those described in the book Interactive Curves and Surfaces (A multimedia tutorial on CAGD) - Rockwell et al.

You do not need to read that book because its text has been transcribed herein as Markdown files in the `md/` directory.  You read the lessons in `md/`, in alphabetic order, sub-directory by sub-directory, file by file.

For example, start reading ` 1 Introduction to CAGD/1.md`

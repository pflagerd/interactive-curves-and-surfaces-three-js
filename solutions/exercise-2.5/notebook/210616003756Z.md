Well, now I want to fix the drawKatex() thing.

I think I need to reproduce https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-align-html-elements-to-3d.html

I created a rendition of the script described above, but using webpack etc.  It's in experiments/html-to-3d.

The whole trick seems to have been calling `tempV.project(canvas)` from within animate(), and the first time its called (and maybe more) doesn't compute non-Infinity.

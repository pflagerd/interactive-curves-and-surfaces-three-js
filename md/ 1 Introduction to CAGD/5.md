### Control Points: The Start of CAGD

![1623196134559](.md/5/1623196134559.png)

Take four points in a plane and connect them to form a polygon.  The four points may be called *control points*, in that they *are points in two or more dimensions that define the behavior of the resulting curve*.  The polygon formed by connecting the control points in the "correct" order are called the *control polygon*.  The control polygon provides a crude analogy of the refined curve.  Note that the control polygon is typically open (the ends are not coincident), and it may self-intersect.  The control points and the control polygon determine the approximate shape of the curve to be formed.

### What CAGD is All About

Computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) is a field that initially developed to bring the advantages of computers to industries such as

* automotive
* aerospace
* shipbuilding

CAGD expanded rapidly and now pervades many areas, from pharmaceutical design to animation.  We are surrounded by products that were first visualized on a computer.  These products were modified and refined entirely with the computer; when the product entered production, the tools and dies were produced directly from the geometry stored in the computer.  This process is known as *virtual prototyping*.

Computer visualizations of new products reduce the design cycle by easing the process of design modification and tool production

CAGD is based on the creation of curves and surfaces and is accurately described as curve and surface modeling.  Using CAGD tools with elaborate user interfaces, designers create and refine their ideas to produce complex results.  They combine large numbers of curve and surface segments to realize their ideas.  However the individual segments they use are relatively simple, and it is at this level that the study of CAGD is concentrated.

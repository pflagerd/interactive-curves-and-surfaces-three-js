<p>A special curve known as the <em>Bézier Curve</em> may be generated by the control points. Notice that while the curve passes through the end-points of the control polygon, it only comes close to the other points.</p>
<p>We will write code for Bézier Curves. Below you can see what’s called a cubic Bézier curve. A cubic Bézier curve is a cubic polynomial. In other words it is a polynomial of degree 3. You can think of a cubic Bézier being described mathematically thus: <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>a</em><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>b</em><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em><em>x</em> + <em>d</em></span> . <iframe style="margin: 0 20% 0 20%; height: 400px; width: 400px; border: none;" data-trusted="1" src="https://en.js.cx/article/bezier-curve/demo.svg?p=0,0,.2,0.7,0.8,.7,1,0"></iframe></p>
<p>A cubic Bézier has four control points which are shown here numbered <span class="math inline">1</span> to <span class="math inline">4</span> . Please move these around on the background grid and notice the effect that their position has on the curve.</p>
<p>Are you beginning to see why Bézier curves are used so frequently in CAGD?</p>
<h4 id="exercise-1.6.1">Exercise 1.6.1</h4>
<p>In this exercise, you’re going to draw add an arc to your last exercise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a copy of your Exercise 1.5.3 and name it Exercise 1.6.1</li>
<li>Add a new Line geometry to your diagram.</li>
<li>Construct the Line geometry from a set of points based on a quadratic polynomial: <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>a</em><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><em>x</em> + <em>c</em></span></li>
<li>Attempt to make your rendering look approximately like the image at the start of this page.</li>
<li>Make sure that you encapsulate this geometry as its own class.</li>
<li>Don’t be surprised if this takes quite a while to get looking right. It’s tricky.</li>
<li>For extra karma, attempt to produce something that looks like the image above using a cubic polynomial: $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + bx + d.</li>
<li>Don’t be surprised if this takes a while to figure out.</li>
</ol>

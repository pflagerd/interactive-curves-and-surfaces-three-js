### The History of CAGD

Computer-aided geometric design has mathematical roots that stretch back to Euclid and Descartes.  Its practical application began with automated machinery to compute, draft and manufacture objects with free-form surfaces.  Production pressures in the aircraft industry during World War II stimulated many new devices to enhance and accelerate design and manufacturing.  For example, in 1944, Liming designed fuselage spars with a "superelliptic method" method that could be implemented with an electromechanical calculator.

Shipbuilders also became interested in CAGD early on.  One example of their motivation may sound trivial but was a serious impediment to ship design.  The only place large enough to draw full-scale plans for a ship was in the loft of the shipbuilders' dry dock.  The huge drawings would warp and shrink in the moist air, causing very real manufacturing problems.

Computers provided the greatest stimulus because of their power to enable new ideas.  In 1963, Ferguson developed one of the first surface patch systems by which individual curvilinear patches are joined smoothly to create the surface "quilt".  He also introduced the notion of parametrically defined surfaces, which has become the standard because if provides freedom from an arbitrarily fixed coordinate system.  Vertical tangent vectors can be defined by differentiation, for instance, which is not possible in explicit Cartesian form.

In the mid 1960s, automotive companies became involved in CAGD as a way to drive milling machines.  Car bodies were designed by artists using clay models.  Painstaking measurements produced data that could drive numerically controlled (NC) milling machines to produce stamp molds.  The initial use of CAGD was to represent the data as a smooth surface for numerical control.  It soon became apparent that the surfaces could be used for the design.

In 1971, Pierre Bézier reformulate Ferguson's ideas so that a draftsman without any extensive mathematical training could design a surface.  Bézier's system, UNISURF, was used by Renault and became a milestone in the development of CAGD.  It epitomized the difference between surface fitting and surface design.  The purpose of design was to provide the draftsman, who had strong intuition about the shape but limited mathematical training, with computer tools that empowered him or her to use the sophisticated mathematics of surface representation.

In the meantime, the mathematical underpinnings of CAGD continued to advance.  De Casteljau examined triangular patches and developed evaluation techniques.  Coons unified much of the previous work into a general scheme that became the basis of the early modeler PDGS made by Ford.  At General Motors in 1974, Gordon and Riesenfeld exploited the properties of b-spline curves and surfaces for design.

Driven primarily by the automotive, shipbuilding and aerospace industries, both the mathematics of CAGD and the designer interface tools continued to improve through the 1970s.  The first CAGD conference was organized by Barnhill and Riesenfeld in 1974, where the term CAGD was first used.

In the 1980s, the power and versatility of computer-aided designing seemed suddenly to be discovered by anyone who had a free-form geometric surface application.  Industrial designers were smitten with the power of computer design, and many commercial modelers became the basis of several substantial applications including CATIA, EUCLID, STRIM, ANVIL, and GEOMOD.

Geo-sciences used CAGD methods to represent seismic horizons; computer graphics designers modeled their objects with surfaces, as did molecule designers for pharmaceuticals.  Architects discovered CAGD, word processing and drafting programs based on their interface protocols on free-form curves (Postscript) and even movie-makers discovered the power of animating with such surfaces, beginning with TRON, continuing through Jurassic Park and beyond.

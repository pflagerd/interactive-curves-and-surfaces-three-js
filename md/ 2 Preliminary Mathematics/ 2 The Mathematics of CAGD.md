### The Mathematics of CAGD

CAGD treats points, lines, and surfaces as mathematical objects, described geometrically in two- or three-dimensional space.

This book develops the mathematics in a step-by-step fashion, and does not demand a rigorous mathematical background. It is recommended that the reader be familiar with the following topics:

* Geometry of points, lines, and planes.
* Equations in parametric form.
* Basic calculus.

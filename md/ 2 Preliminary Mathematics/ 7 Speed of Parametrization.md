For example, the circle can also be given by allowing t to vary from -infinity to +infinity in the following functions:

$$x(t)=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},  y(t)=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\tag{2.6}$$

**Exercise 2.6**

Verify for yourself that the functions in equation 2.2 do indeed generate a circle by  writing a program to plot points $(x(t), y(t))$ for a range of values of $t$.



### Velocity of Parametrization

A good physical model for parametric curves is that of a moving particle.  In this model, the parameter $t$ represents time. At any time $t$ the position of the particle is
$(x(t), y(t))$. 

As the parameter $t$ changes, the coordinate point $(x(t), y(t))$ traces the curve. This point can be thought of as a particle that moves under the influence of
changes in the value of the parameter $t$.

Both equation 2.5 and equation 2.6 yield circles, so how do they differ? 

It is the *velocity* of the parameterization that differs. The velocity of the point $(x(t), y(t))$ is different at different values of $t$ even if the paths (the circles) are the same.

In other words, two curves may be identical even though their velocities of parametrization are different.

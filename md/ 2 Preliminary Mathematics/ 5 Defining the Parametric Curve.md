### Defining the Parametric Curve

A parametric curve that lies in a plane is defined by two functions, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, which use the independent parameter $t$. $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are coordinate functions, since their values represent the coordinates of points on the curve. As $t$ varies, the coordinates $(x(t), y(t))$ sweep out the curve. As an example consider the two functions:

â€‹	$$x(t) = sin(t), y(t) = cos(t) \tag{2.1}$$

As $t$ varies from zero to 2 , a circle is swept out by $(x(t), y(t))$.

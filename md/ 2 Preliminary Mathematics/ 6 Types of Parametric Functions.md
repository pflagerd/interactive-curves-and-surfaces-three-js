 ### Types of Parametric Functions: 1D Polynomial Functions

CAGD deals primarily with *polynomial* or *rational* functions, not trigonometric functions like $sin()$ and $cos()​$ as were used in Exercise 2.5 above. 

One way to represent a polynomial function is using a power series, thus:

​	$$p(t)=a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2+a_3t^3+...+a_nt^n\tag{2.6a}$$

In this case, $\{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n\}$ are scalar real number constants, $t$ is a scalar real number variable, and $p(t)$ is a scalar real number function. 

In mathematical notation:

​	$$t, p(t), a_n \in \mathbb{R}\tag{2.6b}$$

So each scalar real number value of $t$ results in a scalar real number value of $p(t)$. One value in, one value out; A 1D (1 Dimensional) polynomial function.











For example, the circle can also be given by allowing t to vary from -infinity to +infinity in the following functions:

$$x(t)=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2},  y(t)=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\tag{2.6}$$

**Exercise 2.6**

Verify for yourself that the functions in equation 2.2 do indeed generate a circle by  writing a program to plot points $(x(t), y(t))$ for a range of values of $t$.
